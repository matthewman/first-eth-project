# first-eth-project
My first Ethereum project

Created by following tutorial from [Coursetro](https://coursetro.com/courses/20/Developing-Ethereum-Smart-Contracts-for-Beginners)

Tested used [Remix IDE](http://remix.ethereum.org/) and [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/), on Ropsten Test Net, using Injected Web3. 

To launch the website that interacts with the contract on the Ropsten Test Net, locate to the project directory, then run this command

`npm run dev`
